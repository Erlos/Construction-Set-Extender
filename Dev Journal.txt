To-Do
=====
MISC-->
> Nudge IanPat to implement the loader fix
> Turn off debug when releasing builds

BE---->
> Look into the extraData fuckup
> Filter out refs that don't have ownership data and count

CSE--->
> Fully implement GMST reinit
> Figure out how to update the model of references
> Look into fixing lip sync generation
> Set FormID (use a global hook to monitor messages - kludgy but much easier than hooking at several dozen places )

# The ability to specify a custom workspace.
# Allow selecting a faction for the IsCellOwner test in an AI pack's conditions. The function accepts factions in scripts, and the game will honor it if you use TES4Edit to force one in, but you can't use the CS to simply set one.
# NPC refs update visually when their inventory is changed without plugin reload
# Option to automatically dump & reload models on cell load without plugin reload
# Default z-coordinate when one drops pieces in the render window
# On-the-fly adjustment of zoom sensitivity

* The ability to generate more than one distant land LOD per sitting. Currently, you can do one that comes out reasonably well. All subsequent attempts I've ever seen result in a random jumble of useless triangles in the mesh.
* Land LOD meshes that aren't such terrible approximations of the real landscape. I remember seeing somewhere that what we get is a 1% representation of the real thing. Could we bump this to 5% or something?
* The ability to generate landscape LOD textures that are better than the 1024x1024 quality we get now. Something on the quality level of the local maps. Or at the very least higher resolution.
* Fix the bug that causes black squares on the LOD texture if you switch to a different window. Annoying.
* Don't make the LOD texture generator load all the objects on the surface since they're not going to be used in the results anyway. Saves untold amounts of memory.
* Generate the textures and normal maps for LOD land in DXT1 format with appropriate mipmap levels to start with. Easy enough to fix, but why incur extra work?

# Be nice if there was a Sanitize option that forced proper capitalization of function names(begin->Begin, elseif->ElseIf, etc) and stripped excess whitespace.
