MISC	---->
> Credits:	T800G, for the window snapper code
			Ingo Berg, for muParserX (and for the great tech. support)

CSE		----> 
> Fix the csas doc param details data
> Don't forget to correct NiObjectNET's def when updating OBSE source files
> Show Data dialog on startup, as opposed to loading a plugin (either) (use CSAS?)
> Use a tab delimited format for the change logs
> Make selection alignment undo'able
> Check out the assertion at 0x004875A1 (called indirectly from Datahandler::saveplugin_Housekeeping). strangely seems to happen only when IDA's debugger is attached
> Topicinfo inititem warnings aren't being shown
> Export/import result scripts
> Relative scaling and snap to bounding box

* The ability to generate more than one distant land LOD per sitting. Currently, you can do one that comes out reasonably well. All subsequent attempts I've ever seen result in a random jumble of useless triangles in the mesh.
* Land LOD meshes that aren't such terrible approximations of the real landscape. I remember seeing somewhere that what we get is a 1% representation of the real thing. Could we bump this to 5% or something?
* Fix the bug that causes black squares on the LOD texture if you switch to a different window. Annoying.
