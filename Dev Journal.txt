		> Fix undo manger ctd at 0x00431F68; (special marker gets freed); figure out a surefire way to repro this one first
			^ Think it might been caused by the buggy frozen refs support hooks
		> [AFTER 6.0] Investigate if f_TESObjectREFR::SetExtraEditorMoveDataPosition/Rotation needs to be called in the batch editor code; Yup, look into 0x005478A0
		> [AFTER 6.0] Look into washington's request with the region editor; requires a fair amount of TESRegion/TESRegionDataXXX decoding


	ENHANCEMENT		=
		> Investigate into the ModelLoader/IOManager's workings to see if loaded resources can be manually released		
		> Double right click on a form list combo box (TESComboBox) opens it for editing
		> Batch LIP generator tool (the CS' output works fine with Skyrim too!)
		> Increase preview control rendertarget size
		> [AFTER 6.0] Implement a fly camera mode for the render window
		> [AFTER 6.0] Add CK-like Move Reference command (special case harcoded markers, such as north/door/travel markers)
		> [AFTER 6.0] Look into adding a global "undo-buffer"; the last n-changes made to any form can be undone.
