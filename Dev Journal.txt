			Ingo Berg, for muParserX

CSE		---->
> Test the recompile dependencies tool(s)
> Call command results must be cast appropriately before assignment
> Update muParserX to 1.10
> Fix the code in HallOFFame and Exports that was disabled for build error reasons
> Show Data dialog on startup, as opposed to loading a plugin (either) (use CSAS?)
> Use a tab delimited format for the change logs
> Make selection alignment undo'able
> Check out the assertion at 0x004875A1 (called indirectly from Datahandler::saveplugin_Housekeeping). strangely seems to happen only when IDA's debugger is attached
> Topicinfo inititem warnings aren't being shown
> Export/import result scripts
> Fix PlaySoundFile()
> Relative scaling and snap to bounding box

* The ability to generate more than one distant land LOD per sitting. Currently, you can do one that comes out reasonably well. All subsequent attempts I've ever seen result in a random jumble of useless triangles in the mesh.
* Land LOD meshes that aren't such terrible approximations of the real landscape. I remember seeing somewhere that what we get is a 1% representation of the real thing. Could we bump this to 5% or something?
* Fix the bug that causes black squares on the LOD texture if you switch to a different window. Annoying.
