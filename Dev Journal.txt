To-Do
=====
CSE--->
> Fix the code in HallOFFame and Exports that was disabled for build error reasons
> Show Data dialog on startup, as opposed to loading a plugin (either)
> Modify the change log manager to support session logs for multiple concurrent cs sessions
> Use a tab delimited format for the change logs
> The set workspace tool fails to create the default directories when the the root Data directory is created for the first time
> Display a confirmation box on texture generation completion
> Make selection alignment undo'able
> I have another suggestion - on Quest Stages tab, there's a box for Stage indexes. The box size is fine, but perhaps the Index column within the box could be less wide, so that when you create the 41st or 42nd stage (more than fits in the box without needing a scroll bar), it doesn't create a horizontal scroll bar at the bottom when it creates the vertical scroll bar. The column can only contain a number between 0 and 255, so it never needs to be wider than the column header at the top.
> Make sure the changes to the plugin inteface code (AddToURLMap in particular) works with plugins loaded after CSE
> Increase the column header size of the Quests dialog
> Clear quest stage result script text when compiling it (when found empty)
> Check out the assertion at 0x004875A1 (called indirectly from Datahandler::saveplugin_Housekeeping). strangely seems to happen only when IDA's debugger is attached
> Topicinfo inititem warnings aren't being shown
> Update the model of references
> Export/import result scripts
> Fix the f_PlaySoundFile
> Relative scaling and snap to bounding box

# Allow selecting a faction for the IsCellOwner test in an AI pack's conditions. The function accepts factions in scripts, and the game will honor it if you use TES4Edit to force one in, but you can't use the CS to simply set one.
# NPC refs update visually when their inventory is changed without plugin reload
# Option to automatically dump & reload models on cell load without plugin reload
# On-the-fly adjustment of zoom sensitivity

* The ability to generate more than one distant land LOD per sitting. Currently, you can do one that comes out reasonably well. All subsequent attempts I've ever seen result in a random jumble of useless triangles in the mesh.
* Land LOD meshes that aren't such terrible approximations of the real landscape. I remember seeing somewhere that what we get is a 1% representation of the real thing. Could we bump this to 5% or something?
* Fix the bug that causes black squares on the LOD texture if you switch to a different window. Annoying.

> Add a 'No. of Passes' INI key for the script preprocessor
> The Previous script shortcut messes with control focus
> QuickView displays the wrong intellisenseitem text, but the correct title
> A failed compile operation must set the modified flag, regardless of its previous state
> There's a slight X-offset to the position returned by AvalonEditTextEditor::GetPositionFromCharIndex
> Fix the 'Missing New Tab button' repaint issue
