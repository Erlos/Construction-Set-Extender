	ENHANCEMENT		=
		> Temp disable ENB wrapper at load time
		> Multiple preview and object windows
			+ Multiple object windows:
				[[ Try using the first subclass instead of code caving]]
				- Patch org wnd proc's prolog to update the cached HWNDs of the controls
				- Patch init dlg and destroy handlers to account for other caches
				- Track tree view selections of imposters and update g_INI::ObjectSelection_General in the prolog 
				- Same as above for the sort column array
				- Handle the main update/refresh message in the main sub class (imposters have a seperate subclass)
				- Use scoped setters for updating caches
				- Account for GetDlgItem called on the main object window's HWND cache
					ObjectWindow::ProcessForm() calls are outside the wnd proc hierarchy and can't be reliably accounted for
					Possible workaround - refresh all imposters on new form creation 
						patch the above funct's epilog and only refresh if the caller was DataHandler::AddForm() and a plugin load isn't in progress
		> Option to disable asymmetry when generating a new NPC face
		> Reference parent-child visual aid (similar to path grid points and their linked refs)
		> Add CK-like Move Reference command (special case harcoded markers, such as north/door/travel markers)
		> Investigate into the ModelLoader/IOManager's workings to see if loaded resources can be manually released		
		> Grass rendering
		> Add a random "roughness" factor to the landscape sculpting brush
