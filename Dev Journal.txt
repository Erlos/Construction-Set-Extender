To-Do
=====

IMMEDIATE  >>


NOTE	---->
> Include empty versions of the newly added default directories in the mod package
> Mention the changes made to the LOD INI settings to get all objects to render to the LOD diffuse maps
> Bundle CS1.0 with the main package
> Bundle the license agreements of the various requisite assemblies
> Clean up the readMe - Lot of redundant info there.


MISC	---->
> Credits:	JRoush, for allowing the use of COEF's code
	Kyoma, for his contributions with the class definitions


CSE		---->
> Double right click on a form list combo box (TESComboBox) opens it for editing
> Look into the activator bug (blind dump)
> TESFile CreateFileMapping assertion - http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/283608-construction-set-extender-endorsements/page__st__260__p__4976561#entry4976561
> Allow wav files to be passed to the lip generator (currently, it expects the input file to be a MP3 file)
> Reset list view sorting during item addition
> Go into Cell View. Right click on any interior cell->Edit. The Cell dialog comes up. If you click in any of the cell names on the left, they all gain a "*" and thus become dirt.
> Editing an unrendered ref. (ie load the CK and ESMs, single-click any cell on the left, right click a ref., Edit, change a value) results in an assertion error: (and moves it to the default Tamriel worldspace)
> Ref properties loses focus to the render window on init and every time the 3d data fields are modified
> Increase preview control rendertarget size
> Prevent control redrawing wherever possible; TESDialog::BuildSubwindow, WM_INITDIALOG in FormEdit/FormIDListView
> Context Menu on TESBoundObjects -> Preview
> http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1250150-rel-construction-set-extender/page__view__findpost__p__20306934
> Wrap all editorAPI instance data
> Option to freeze all refs in the Oblivion master file (or any master file) (to prevent accidental edits)
> Partial black tex hasn't been fixed yet, generator still seems to crash after hitting a mem limit (around 850MB)
	< THen again, might not be a mem issue. Try reducing the size of the textures
> Batch LIP generator tool (the CS' output works fine with Skyrim too!)
> Toggle visibility/reveal needs to update the ninodes after unculling
> Add CK-like Move Reference command (special case harcoded markers, such as north/door/travel markers)
> Fix undo manger ctd at 0x00431F68; (special marker gets freed)
> Investigate into the ModelLoader/IOManager's workings to see if loaded resources can be manually released
> Main window positions not working well with 2nd mon; main window states aren't correctly inited by the InitializeWindows hook
> Look into Konption's kf CTD; add a skeleton/kf/model tester tool that wraps the various 3d init subs in SEH (will leak pointers 'doh!)
> Multiple object windows
> Invert render window selection
> Implement a fly camera mode for the render window

> [AFTER 6.0] Look into washington's request with the region editor; requires a fair amount of TESRegion/TESRegionDataXXX decoding
> [AFTER 6.0] Investigate if f_TESObjectREFR::SetExtraEditorMoveDataPosition/Rotation needs to be called in the batch editor code; Yup, look into 0x005478A0
> [AFTER 6.0] Look into adding a global "undo-buffer"; the last n-changes made to any form can be undone.
> [AFTER 6.0] Add a color overlay to objects under the selection rubber band

Coda Commands
> GetBaseForm - Ref


SE		---->
> Recheck with the mem profiler
> Workspace deallocs sometimes go unnoticed by the manager, leading it to think there are active instances
> PgUp and PgDn backwards for tab selection
> Partial search string match for the script list dialog
> ISInterface listview sorting takes a long time when commands are being populated
> [AFTER 6.0] New sanitze function: Anneal identifier casing - Fixup editorIds, var names and command IDs
> [AFTER 6.0] A code snippets manager, integrated into IntelliSense
